For example, the locality of an an endpoint in US, in US-East-1 region, within availability zone az-1, in data center rack r11 can be represented as us/us-east-1/az-1/r11. Istio will configure the sidecar to route to endpoints within the same locality as the sidecar. If none of the endpoints in the locality are available, endpoints parent locality (but within the same network ID) will be chosen. For example, if there are two endpoints in same network (networkID \"n1\"), say e1 with locality us/us-east-1/az-1/r11 and e2 with locality us/us-east-1/az-2/r12, a sidecar from us/us-east-1/az-1/r11 locality will prefer e1 from the same locality over e2 from a different locality.
